## NO RSF CHROME EXTENSION

### Installation:

1. Copy all the files here (except the .crx file) to a folder on your computer,
enable `Developer mode` on `chrome://extensions`, click
`Load unpacked extension...`, and load that folder

    OR

    Open `chrome://extensions` and drag in the `no-rsf.crx` file (this probably
      won't work)

2. Reload any page with RSF spam

3. 0x5a82ee27896A0a2c4f2A80d1e9e7a696b0664e1D
